We started off strong with the breakfast nachos as our appetizer. The highlight of the nachos were a gravy covering that resembled chipped beef gravy sauce. The chips were nice and chrispy despite the hefty toppings covering them. They came with dippy eggs, sausage, and a good portion of guac.

For our entrees, Luis had the Burger Burger and Zeshan had the Chicken and Waffles. They were pretty good portions and we had a hard time finishing the food. The fries were crispy and went very well with the remaining nacho dip. The burger burger was very burgery, living up to its name. With a thick patty and huge pickles, it was enjoyed. The fried chicken and waffle combination was great, especially covered in syrup.

Throughout the meal, we enjoyed a cup of classic coffee with unlimited refills. We sat outside and enjoyed the 80 degree day at a table in the shade. Our surroundings were pretty, with a clean walking street and potted flowers in our vicinity. 

Luis did not like the cantaloupe, but that was a personal problem. Zeshan enjoyed all the fresh fruit, including the cantaloupe. 

We were too full for dessert and took some of the chicken waffles home to enjoy later.
